#Create User Stories - How to build a algorithm to distinguish between Gr37 and Gr38

#User Stories

#User Requirement

#To identify information from LRG XML files, whether a particular gene has changed between one build to another.

#Question for users

#Q1. What input and output files would you like to query in relation to LRG?

#A1 Gene names, transcript IDs, coordinates (genomic, exon, transcript)

#Q2. What variables do they want to look at from each file?

#A2 LRG genomic coordinates, build37, build38 coordinates

#Q3. What information do we need to compare and contrast between different genes in XML.

#A3 exon start and end, transcript start and end

#4. Create a script that automatically pulls LRG XML files for each genes

#5. Export the information into excel or text file.

#6. Testing of user input, build assert statements to check the output of each function.
